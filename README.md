HumanHash
========

An algorithm for generating natural-language-based cryptographic hashes.

* * * * *

USAGE
-----

~~~~~
humanhash [-h] [-x] [-n LENGTH]
          [-a {md5,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha384,sha512}] [-m]
          [input]
~~~~~

`-h, --help`
  shows a short help message

`-x, --hex`
  specifies that input is in the form of a pre-computed hexadecimal number, 
  rather than a filename

`-n, --length` *LENGTH*
  length of output, in number of sentences

`-a, --algorithm` *{md5,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha384,sha512}*
  algorithm used to compute the cryptographic digest, defaults to sha512

`-m, --mnemonic`
  instead of generating a paragraph, produces a two-word mnemonic codename

API
---

~~~~~
$ python setup.py install

>>> import hhlib
>>> h = hhlib.HH(msg = message, algorithm = "sha512")
>>> h.update(message)
>>> h.paragraph(length)
~~~~~

HISTORY
-------

The HumanHash algorithm was originally conceived and implemented as 
[All Hands Active](http://allhandsactive.com/), the first hackerspace in Ann 
Arbor, MI, was working on ratifying its first bylaws, around January 2011. 
HumanHash was used as a mechanism to for generating unambiguous, deterministic 
codenames for revisions of the bylaws. See example usage on 
[AHA's mailing list](http://goo.gl/CVF1F).
